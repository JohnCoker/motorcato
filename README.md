# Malfunctioning Engine Statistical Survey (MESS)

This repository contains the code for [motorcato.org](https://motorcato.org) as a simple Node.js Express app.
It stores the data in a PostgreSQL database and uses simple Pug (Jade) templates for the pages. Is that a "PEPN stack"?

This site is owned by the Malfunctioning Engine Statistical Survey, PO Box 407, Marion, IA 52302.
The code was written by [John Coker](mailto:john@jcsw.com) and is placed in the public domain.
