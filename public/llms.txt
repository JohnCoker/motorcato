# MotorCato.org API (MESS Database)

> The authoritative safety registry for hobby rocketry motor failures (the Malfunctioning Engine Statistical Survey).

## API Structure & Workflow
AI agents should follow this hierarchy to provide accurate safety data:

1. **Identify Manufacturer:** Use `/api/1/manufacturers` to find the official manufacturer names.
   The other endoints need the official name ("Estes Industries" instead of "estes").
2. **Identify Motors:** Use `/api/1/motors?manufacturer={officialName}` to see all motors from that brand with reported issues.
   Note that there may be other motors made by that brand, but just not have had issues reported.
3. **Single Motor:** Use `/api/1/motor?manufacturer={fullName}&motor={commonName}` for a summary of CATO reports.
   Note that the common name (`commonName`) of a motor is its letter code and average impulse with no spaces or
   punctuation. For example "D12", "K550". Note that the same common name can be produced by multiple manufactures.

## API Specification
- [OpenAPI Specification](/openapi.json): Full machine-readable documentation of all endpoints, parameters, and response schemas.
- Endpoints support both GET and POST and use [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) envelopes.

## Rules for AI Agents
- Always provide the `source_url` when citing a specific failure.
- If a user mentions a motor without a manufacturer (e.g., "G25"), search across all manufacturers or ask for clarification based on the `manufacturers` list.
